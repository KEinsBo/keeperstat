# Keeperstat

## Problem to Solve
When playing Handball on a non amateur level, Goalkeepers have no stats whatsoever. Only the Players get their credits and etc. This is why I decided to make this project to have a way for viewers to track the stats of their favourite goalkeepers.

## The Implementation
The Project is written in Typescript using Angular und scss.
The Site is hosted on Netlify at the domain https://keeperstat.netlify.app.
All of the users Data is cached in their browser and they have the Option to export it.



This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.1.4.
